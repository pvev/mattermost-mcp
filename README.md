# Mattermost MCP Server

MCP Server for the Mattermost API, enabling Claude and other MCP clients to interact with Mattermost workspaces.

## Features

This MCP server provides tools for interacting with Mattermost, including:

### Topic Monitoring

The server includes a topic monitoring system that can:
- Monitor specified channels for messages containing topics of interest
- Run on a configurable schedule (using cron syntax)
- Send notifications when relevant topics are discussed
- Mention you in a specified channel when topics are found

### Channel Tools
- `mattermost_list_channels`: List public channels in the workspace
- `mattermost_get_channel_history`: Get recent messages from a channel

### Message Tools
- `mattermost_post_message`: Post a new message to a channel
- `mattermost_reply_to_thread`: Reply to a specific message thread
- `mattermost_add_reaction`: Add an emoji reaction to a message
- `mattermost_get_thread_replies`: Get all replies in a thread

### Monitoring Tools
- `mattermost_run_monitoring`: Trigger the topic monitoring process immediately

### User Tools
- `mattermost_get_users`: Get a list of users in the workspace
- `mattermost_get_user_profile`: Get detailed profile information for a user

## Setup

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/mattermost-mcp.git
cd mattermost-mcp
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Configure the server:
   
   The repository includes a `config.json` file with placeholder values. For your actual configuration, create a `config.local.json` file (which is gitignored) with your real credentials:

   ```json
   {
     "mattermostUrl": "https://your-mattermost-instance.com/api/v4",
     "token": "your-personal-access-token",
     "teamId": "your-team-id",
     "monitoring": {
       "enabled": false,
       "schedule": "*/15 * * * *",
       "channels": ["town-square", "off-topic"],
       "topics": ["tv series", "champions league"],
       "messageLimit": 50
     }
   }
   ```

   This approach keeps your real credentials out of the repository while maintaining the template for others.

4. Build the server:
```bash
npm run build
```

5. Run the server:
```bash
npm start
```

## Topic Monitoring Configuration

The monitoring system can be configured with the following options:

- `enabled` (boolean): Whether monitoring is enabled
- `schedule` (string): Cron expression for when to check for new messages (e.g., "*/15 * * * *" for every 15 minutes)
- `channels` (string[]): Array of channel names to monitor
- `topics` (string[]): Array of topics to look for in messages
- `messageLimit` (number): Number of recent messages to analyze per check
- `notificationChannelId` (string, optional): Channel ID where notifications will be sent. If not provided, the system will automatically use a direct message channel.
- `userId` (string, optional): Your user ID for mentions in notifications. If not provided, the system will automatically detect the current user.

To enable monitoring, set `enabled` to `true` in your `config.local.json` file.

### Running Monitoring Manually

You can trigger the monitoring process manually in several ways:

1. **Using the provided scripts**:
   - `./run-monitoring-http.sh` - Triggers monitoring via HTTP without restarting the server (recommended)
   - `./run-monitoring.sh` - Starts a new server instance with monitoring enabled
   - `./trigger-monitoring.sh` - Runs the monitoring process and exits (useful for cron jobs)
   - `./view-channel-messages.js <channel-name> [count]` - View the last messages in a channel
   - `./analyze-channel.js <channel-name> [count]` - Analyze message statistics in a channel
   - `./get-last-message.js <channel-name>` - Get the last message from a channel

2. **Using the command-line interface (CLI)**:
   - While the server is running, simply type one of these commands in the terminal:
     - `run` - Run the monitoring process
     - `monitor` - Same as `run`
     - `check` - Same as `run`
   - Other available commands:
     - `help` - Show available commands
     - `exit` - Shutdown the server

3. **Using the MCP tool**:
   - Use the `mattermost_run_monitoring` tool through the MCP interface
   - This will immediately check all configured channels for your topics of interest

4. **Using the command-line flags**:
   - Start the server with the `--run-monitoring` flag:
   ```bash
   npm start -- --run-monitoring
   ```
   - This will run the monitoring process immediately after the server starts
   - Add `--exit-after-monitoring` to exit after the monitoring process completes:
   ```bash
   npm start -- --run-monitoring --exit-after-monitoring
   ```
   - This is useful for running the monitoring process from cron jobs

## Usage with Claude Desktop

Add the following to your `claude_desktop_config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mattermost": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": [
        "/path/to/mattermost-mcp/build/index.js"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter permission errors, verify that:
1. Your personal access token has the necessary permissions
2. The token is correctly copied to your configuration
3. The Mattermost URL and team ID are correct

## HTTP Endpoints

The server exposes HTTP endpoints for remote control:

- **Run Monitoring**: `http://localhost:3456/run-monitoring`
  - Triggers the monitoring process immediately
  - Returns JSON response with success/error information

- **Check Status**: `http://localhost:3456/status`
  - Returns information about the server and monitoring status
  - Useful for health checks

You can use these endpoints with curl or any HTTP client:
```bash
# Trigger monitoring
curl http://localhost:3456/run-monitoring

# Check status
curl http://localhost:3456/status
```

## Utility Scripts

### run-monitoring-http.sh

This script triggers the monitoring process via the HTTP endpoint:
```bash
./run-monitoring-http.sh
```

This is the recommended way to trigger monitoring manually as it:
- Doesn't restart the server
- Doesn't interfere with the scheduled monitoring
- Works reliably from any terminal

### view-channel-messages.js

This script allows you to view the most recent messages in any channel:

```bash
# View messages in a channel (channel name is required)
node view-channel-messages.js <channel-name>

# View a specific number of messages
node view-channel-messages.js <channel-name> <message-count>

# Example: View the last 10 messages in a channel
node view-channel-messages.js general 10
```

The script will display:
- Channel information (name, purpose, total message count)
- The most recent messages with timestamps and usernames
- If the channel doesn't exist, it will list all available channels

### analyze-channel.js

This script provides detailed statistics about messages in a channel:

```bash
# Analyze messages in a channel (channel name is required)
node analyze-channel.js <channel-name>

# Analyze a specific number of messages
node analyze-channel.js <channel-name> <message-count>

# Example: Analyze the last 50 messages in a channel
node analyze-channel.js general 50
```

The script will display:
- Channel information and metadata
- Total message count (including system messages)
- Breakdown of user messages vs. system messages
- Message count by user
- The most recent messages in the channel

### get-last-message.js

This script retrieves only the most recent message from a channel:

```bash
# Get the last message from a channel (channel name is required)
node get-last-message.js <channel-name>

# Example: Get the last message from the general channel
node get-last-message.js general
```

The script will display:
- The sender's user ID and username
- The timestamp of the message
- The full message content
